The final course in WPI's unified robotics course series is Unified Robotics IV: Navigation. This course focus on the core robotics concepts of localization, path planning, and navigation as well as teaching skills such as command line programming, hardware/computer troubleshooting, and using secure-shell protocol (SSH) to remotely connect to and control robots. The goal of the project was to design a program that could autonomously command a Turtlebot3 robot equipped with a LiDAR scanner to navigate and map mazes of varying complexity. After mapping the entire maze, the robot then needed to be capable of localizing itself at any point within the maze and navigating to a target location.
