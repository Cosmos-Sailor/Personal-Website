Overall, this process taught us valuable skills in image generation, dataset augmentation, and implementing more sophisticated machine learning architectures. One mistake we made that we would do differently next time, was not checking the video before generating our dataset. In the final video that we tested our dataset against, the windows were much closer, took up much more of the screen, and were sometimes cut off by the edge of the frame. In contrast, the dataset we trained our algorithm on had much smaller windows, often showcased these windows at a much sharper angle, and rarely had windows that were cut off by the edge of the frame. If we had accounted for these attributes in our dataset, we may have had more success when testing it. Despite this, we were still able to achieve an accuracy of 88.0% for our test dataset and adequately track the frames in the test video.
