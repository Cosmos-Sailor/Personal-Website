This project involved the creation of a convolutional neural network with a Unet architecture for the identification of drone racing gates. The network was trained and tested on a dataset artificially generated from Blender and augmented using Pythonâ€™s torchvision.transforms library. Additionally, the network reached an accuracy of 95% on the testing sample and demonstrated success at tracking gates in a sample video that was not a part of the dataset.
